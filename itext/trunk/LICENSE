Licensing

  Although iText is a free/open source software (F/OSS) project, giving you a lot of freedom and flexibility regarding the use of the iText software, this doesnâ€™t mean you're free to do anything you want with the product: you have to respect the Affero General Public License.
  You can be released from the requirements of the license by purchasing a commercial license from iText Software Corp.
  Buying such a license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities involving the iText software without disclosing the source code of your own applications. These activities include: offering paid services to customers as an ASP, serving PDFs on the fly in a web application, shipping iText with a closed source product.


Why buy a license?

  An iText commercial license provides advantages not available with the open-source AGPL license. The specific benefits of a commercial license include:
    - Indemnification in the event of IP (intellectual property) or patent infringement
    - Release from the requirements of the copyleft AGPL license, which include:
      . distribution of all source code including your own product, including if it is a web-based application
      . licensing of your own product under the AGPL license
      . prominent mention and inclusion of the iText copyright and the AGPL license
      . disclosure of modifications
    - Release from the requirement to not change the PDF Producer line in the generated PDF properties
